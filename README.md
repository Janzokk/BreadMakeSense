Bread Make Sense (The sensational game)
Made by Jan Perez Guitart (jpg) and Joel Ferrer Riera (ferrerjoel)

In this game You have to make bread. To make bread you have to click the bread. When you have enough breads you can buy upgrades (more than one) at the shop that clicks for you. That's it. Happy bread making.

Is very interesting and fun

This is our first game and a final project for college (so pls dont be to harsh), we will update probablly to improve or fix some functions
